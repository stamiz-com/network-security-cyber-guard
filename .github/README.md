## The Website

The easiest method for consuming the checklist is via our website, at: **[cyberio.pro](https://t.me/cyberseeya)**

Here you can browse lists, filter by your threat model and tick items off once complete (plus, there's pretty charts to make you feel good about your progress ☺️).

### About
The source for the website is in [`web/`](https://t.me/cyberseeya).<br />
The site is built with Qwik, using TypeScript and some components from DaisyUI.


### Deploying
To deploy the app, follow the developing steps above, then run `yarn build.static`. You can then deploy it by copying the `dist/` directory to any CDN, web server or static hosting provider of your choice.

Alternatively, fork the repo and import into your providers dashboard. Or use the link below for an easy 1-click deploy 😉
