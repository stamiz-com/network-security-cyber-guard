## The Website

The easiest method for consuming the checklist is via our website, at: **[cyberio.pro](https://t.me/cyberseeya)**

Here you can browse lists, filter by your threat model and tick items off once complete (plus, there's pretty charts to make you feel good about your progress ‚ò∫Ô∏è).

## Contributing
All checklist data is stored in [`personal-security-checklist.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/HEAD/personal-security-checklist.yml). This is pulled in the website at build-time, and referenced by the API, and is also dynamically inserted into the markdown [Checklist page](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist/blob/HEAD/CHECKLIST.md).

So if you only wish to make changes to the data, this is the only file you need to edit.

Important: When submitting your pull request, provide references backing up any information that you're adding/amending/removing.

For modifying the website or API source, see the developing sections above for instructions on running locally.
